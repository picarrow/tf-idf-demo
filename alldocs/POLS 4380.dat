POLS 4380 - Policy Making Process
Focuses on the central role of Congress in shaping public policy. The
Constitution created three co-equal branches of government, but the
power of the purse, the power to make laws and the power to conduct
oversight into the actions of the Executive all lie with the Congress.
Enrollment limited to Archer Center Fellows.
