MUEN 1145 - Concert Chorale
University Chorale is open to any student who is interested in expanding
his/her skills in choral singing and broadening his/her experience by
performing a variety of choral literature from the Renaissance to the
present day. Generally two to three concert performances will be
presented each semester. No audition is necessary, although a conference
with the director is required prior to enrollment. May be repeated for
credit.
