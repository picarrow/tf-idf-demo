PHAR 7165 - Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience
(IPPE) 5
The Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE) 5 course
provides students with an understanding of many aspects of senior care.
The course is divided into two sections. The students will be able to gain
valuable experience in a closed door pharmacy setting that specifically
delivers medications to long-term care facilities for three weeks. They
will be able to understand the operational aspects of dispensing and
delivery to an institutional setting. The other part of the experience
(four weeks), students are paired with a senior patient living in a nursing
home. Students will complete assignments with their senior patient on
communication strategies, screening tests, medications and conditions
that effect the senior population.
Prerequisite: PHAR 7164.
