MENG 4315 - Senior Design II
The senior design project, which was begun in MENG 4115, continues
to completion. This major capstone design project builds on previous
course work, includes all stages of the design process, and takes into
account a variety of realistic constraints, such as manufacturability and
sustainability; economic factors; and environmental, safety, and
reliability issues. Preparation and presentation of final oral and written
reports are required. The design project may be a team effort and may be
defined in conjunction with industry. Three three-hour design studios per
week.
Prerequisite: MENG 4115.
