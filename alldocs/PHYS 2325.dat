PHYS 2325 - University Physics I [TCCN: PHYS 2325]
A general study of the fundamental principles of physics for science,
computer science, and engineering majors. The principles of mechanics
and heat are studied using a calculus-based approach. Students may not
receive credit for both PHYS 1301 and PHYS 2325. This course satisfies
3 hours of either the STEM or LPS core requirements.
Prerequisite: MATH 2413. Physics in high school is strongly
recommended.
