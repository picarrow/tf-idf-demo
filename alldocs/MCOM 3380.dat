MCOM 3380 - Brand Identity Design
Brand Identity Design covers the theory and practice of creating brand
identity design products. A brand is expressed in a system of tangible
items that fuel the recognition of that brand. These items will typically
have a strong identity that separates them or makes them stand out from
the crowd of brands on the market. The emphasis in this course is for
students to learn brand strategy and what it takes to Zag or be very
different. By practice learn how to create and design projects such as
logos, print ads, stationery, business cards, that support and enhance the
brand with the aid of various graphic applications.
Prerequisite: MCOM 2306 Media Design or demonstrated competency
with software.
