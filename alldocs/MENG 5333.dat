MENG 5333 - Composite Materials
Explores fundamental relationships between both the mechanical and
hygrothermal behavior and the composition of multiphase media with an
emphasis on fiber-reinforced polymers. Topics include using analytical
tools to calculate strength, behavior, and failure of lamina.
Prerequisite: MENG 3306 or equivalent.
