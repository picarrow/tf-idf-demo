TECH 3343 - Advanced Technologies for Surveyors
This course covers High Definition Surveying (HDS) which is becoming
the industry standard for surveying projects and any additional new
surveying topics. Students will gain experience in using a pulsed laser
which moves across a target recording an unprecedented number of
measurements in minutes. In addition, students will learn how to
manipulate these scanned measurements with application software that
will allow them to create three dimensional maps of the land to be
surveyed.
