NURS 5333 - Art of Precepting
This course is designed as a method to develop nurse preceptors who will
assist new nurses to become competent, caring, and valued members of
the health care team. The preceptor will assist in acclimating the new
nurse to the work culture of professional nursing and in making the
transition from student to professional.
