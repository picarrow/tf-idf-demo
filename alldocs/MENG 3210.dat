MENG 3210 - Mechanical Engineering Laboratory I
Experimental measurement of electromechanical systems. Sensors for
measuring Strain, Force, Pressure, Displacement, Acceleration, and
Temperature will be introduced as well as data acquisition and signal
processing techniques. Student teams will design, analyze and document
an experimental procedure. All procedures will result in a professional
quality laboratory report. One hour of lecture and three hours of
laboratory per week.
Prerequisite: ENGR 1201 or completion of a technical writing course,
MENG 2201, PHYS 2326, PHYS 2126.
