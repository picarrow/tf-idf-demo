PHAR 7127 - Social-Behavioral Aspect of Health Care
This course offers an overview of the social-behavioral aspects of health
care. The pharmacist's role is explored in the context of major social
issues affecting health care - in particular medication safety issues -
integrating information from both pharmaceutical and social sciences.
Students may use this knowledge towards understanding the individual
needs of the patient in a practice setting. The course will help students
consider how organizations and social systems impact patient
experiences with medications, contributing to an improved system of
patient-centered practice and care.
Prerequisite: PHAR 7606.
