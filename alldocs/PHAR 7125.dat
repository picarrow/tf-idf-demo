PHAR 7125 - Principles of Drug Design
This course provides basic understanding to principles of drug discovery,
design and development. The topics covered include choosing a disease,
identifying drug targets, establishing testing procedures, finding a lead
compound, lead optimization, performing the preclinical and clinical
trials, and introducing new drugs to the market. The course will have
more emphasis on the methods used to design a lead compound, such as
ligand/structure-based drug design methods. It will also explain the
approaches used in improving the pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic properties of lead compounds. Recent advances in drug
design such as the use of molecular modeling software tools will also be
presented.
Prerequisite: CHEM 3342 or PHAR 7602.
