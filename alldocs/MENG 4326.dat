MENG 4326 - Finite Element Methods in Mechanical
Engineering
An introduction to the finite element method in mechanical engineering.
Emphasizes linear stress and strain analysis, but includes other field
problems. Utilizes commercial computer codes to solve stress analysis,
heat transfer, and other engineering related problems. Three hours of
lecture per week with integrated lab.
Prerequisite: MATH 3203, MENG 3306, and MENG 3316.
