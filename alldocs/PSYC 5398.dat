PSYC 5398 - Research Seminar
This course is a capstone experience in which the student identifies a
research topic, conducts comprehensive literature reviews, and then
develops a substantial written Research Seminar Paper, which may be a
critical literature review, an original small empirical research project, an
original applied evaluation project, or an original grant proposal. The
Research Seminar Paper will be in the form of a professional journal
article manuscript.
